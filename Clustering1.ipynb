    "\n",
    "1. K-means Clustering:\n",
    "   > Approach: Divides the data into k clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and the centroid of their assigned cluster.\n",
    "   > Assumptions: Assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized, and the data points within a cluster are close to the centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "   > Approach: Builds a tree of clusters by successively merging or splitting existing clusters based on the similarity between data points.\n",
    "   > Assumptions: No explicit assumption about cluster shape. It can handle non-spherical clusters and does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Fuzzy C-means (FCM):\n",
    "   > Approach: Similar to K-means but assigns degrees of membership to each data point for each cluster, allowing for overlapping clusters.\n",
    "   > Assumptions: Does not require strict assignment of data points to clusters and allows for uncertainty in cluster assignments.\n",
